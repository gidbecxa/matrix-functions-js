# matrix-functions-js
 A package containing functions for basic matrix calculations.
 
This repo contains functions that help with basic matrix calculations such as finding determinants and multiplying matrices. 
This will be in the near future a vast JavaScript matrix library helping with complex matrix calculations and its applications in various areas of science.
As an Open Source project, I'd be glad to have JavaScript experts build further on what is done here. I believe that this small project could become a great tool.
